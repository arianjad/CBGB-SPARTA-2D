# Handoff: tracing BaF+ through the completed 3D neon field

This picks up after `docs/hpc-fluor-cell-3d-handoff.md` -- you should
already have a completed, settled `cases/fluor-cell-3d` neon DSMC run
(a `field.grid` file with several complete, non-transient frames). If you
don't, stop and finish that first; this doc assumes it as an input and
does not repeat that setup.

**What this is**: does the hot (500 eV) BaF+ beam make it through the
cell, how much is lost, and how does that depend on buffer gas flow rate.
Not a detailed ion-collision-physics study -- see the "What this
deliberately does NOT model" section before reading too much into any one
number.

## 0. What's new here

`tracer/ParticleTracing3D.jl` is a new file, not a modification of the
existing `tracer/ParticleTracing.jl` (which stays 2D-axisymmetric-only,
used by `cases/b5-lean` and `cases/takahashi-single`, untouched). It
reuses that file's collision physics unchanged -- `collide!`, the exact
flux-weighted collision-partner sampler, and `freePath` are already a
general elastic two-body treatment, correct for any mass ratio and any
relative velocity, not a near-thermal approximation, so a 500 eV ion
slowing through 23K neon needs no new physics there. What's new is 3D
geometry (segment-vs-triangle-mesh collision detection against
`cell_fluor3d.surf`'s real triangulation, with a spatial grid so this
doesn't degrade to an O(triangle count) scan per free-flight step) and a
true 3D field lookup (no assumed axisymmetry, since this geometry's
off-axis gas inlet genuinely isn't axisymmetric).

**Testing status**: smoke-tested locally (single- and multi-threaded, a
slow near-thermal case and a fast 500 eV-equivalent case) against a
synthetic cube geometry and synthetic field, not against your real
`cell_fluor3d.surf`/`field.grid` -- those weren't available on the
machine that wrote this. Two real bugs were caught and fixed in that
testing (both noted in the file's own comments where they were fixed):
a zero-width lookup-table range that crashes on near-uniform field data,
and a `Threads.threadid()` assumption that breaks on some Julia versions'
thread-pool models. Treat your first real run as the actual first
end-to-end test of this code, and go through the validation checklist in
section 4 before trusting any result from it.

## 1. Freeze one field frame

`field.grid` accumulates one snapshot per `dump grid` interval over the
whole run (append-only) -- same situation as the 2D pipeline, which uses
`tools/field2tracer.py` to pick one frame before the tracer reads it. The
3D case doesn't need that tool's coordinate remapping or He-specific mass-
density conversion (the 3D tracer reads SPARTA's native column layout
directly), so there's a much simpler equivalent:

```bash
python tools/field3d_freeze.py "$DSMC_RUN_ROOT/<your-run-name>" \
  --out cases/fluor-cell-3d/frozen_field.grid
```

Default is the latest complete frame (same selection flags as
`field2tracer.py`: `--timestep`, `--until-step`, `--until-ms` + `--dt`).
Confirm you're not freezing a still-transient frame -- same settling
caveat as the 2D pipeline (README: "Allow the first 10ms for settling").

## 2. Smoke test against the real geometry

Before spending real particle-count/statistics budget, run a handful of
particles and actually look at the output:

```bash
cd cases/fluor-cell-3d
julia --project=../../tracer --threads=4 ../../tracer/ParticleTracing3D.jl \
  cell_fluor3d.surf frozen_field.grid \
  -n 20 -x 0.03048 -y 0.01905 -z 0.01905 \
  --vx 24843.71 --vy 0 --vz 0 \
  -m 20.1797 -M 156.325 \
  --saveall 1 --seed 1
```

(`--sigma-model table` is the default: the computed BaF+-Ne cross-section
curve in `tracer/data/bafplus_ne_sigma_tracer.tsv` -- see section 3. The previous
models are still available as `--sigma-model edep` and `--sigma-model const --sigma <value>`.)

Check before anything else:
- It runs without erroring. If it crashes on a range/bounds error, that's
  a real-data edge case this local smoke testing didn't happen to hit --
  see the comments at the two fixed bugs in `ParticleTracing3D.jl` for
  what that class of bug looks like, and don't just silence the error.
- `--spawnclip` (on by default) didn't reject the spawn point as inside
  geometry. The spawn point (0.03048, 0.01905, 0.01905) is the molecule-
  inlet port's location from `gen_fluor3d.py` -- if that's wrong (e.g. the
  port moved because the geometry changed since this doc was written),
  every particle will fail to spawn and it'll error out after 1000 tries.
- The output rows' exit positions and velocities make physical sense (see
  section 4) -- don't just check "did it produce numbers."

## 3. Physics parameters

| Parameter | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `-M` (BaF+ mass) | `156.325` amu | Matches the existing `cases/b5-lean/baf-hot-source.conf` (156.325 u) |
| `-m` (buffer gas mass) | `20.1797` amu | Neon, matches `ne.species` |
| `--vx` | `24843.71` m/s | v = sqrt(2 * 500eV / m_BaF+); recompute if the injection energy changes |
| `-x -y -z` | `0.03048 0.01905 0.01905` | Molecule-inlet port location (2.54mm channel, axial) |
| `--sigma-model` | `table` (default) | Computed BaF+-Ne cross section vs collision energy -- see below |
| `--sigma-table-variant` | `central` (default) | `low`/`high` bracket the short-range-wall uncertainty (only matters above ~1 eV) |
| `-T` | `0.0` (default) | Perfectly monoenergetic, mono-directional beam. **This is a simplification, not a measurement** -- if the real source has known energy/angular spread, set a nonzero `-T` (adds a thermal-style spread around the mean velocity) or check whether that spread matters for your conclusion before assuming it doesn't. |

**Cross section -- CURRENT (supersedes everything below).** The default is
now `--sigma-model table`, a computed BaF+-Ne cross section covering the whole
500 eV-to-thermal range (`tracer/data/bafplus_ne_sigma_tracer.tsv`; derivation and
scripts in `tools/cross_section/`):

- Physics: classical momentum-transfer cross section Q1(E) for a Ba+-Ne proxy
  potential -- the CCSD(T)/CBS Ba+-Ne potential of Buchachenko & Viehland,
  J. Chem. Phys. 148, 154304 (2018) (well + exact ion-induced-dipole C4 = alpha_Ne/2)
  joined to the ZBL universal repulsion at short range. Checks: reproduces the
  1.105 x Langevin polarization limit; agrees with ZBL/SRIM universal nuclear
  stopping to 2-15% at 100-500 eV lab.
- Tracer mapping: the file is NOT bare Q1. Because the tracer uses a flux-weighted
  partner + isotropic scattering at rate n*sigma*v_coll, the table is the
  drag-matched sigma_t(E_cm) that makes the tracer's mean drag equal the true
  drag at every ion speed. It equals Q1 for fast ions and gives the correct thermal
  diffusion coefficient at rest (2.0e-18 m^2 at 23 K). Bare Q1 is kept as
  `tracer/data/bafplus_ne_q1.tsv` for reference only -- don't pass it to `--sigma-table`.
- Key values (sigma_t): 2.0e-18 m^2 thermal (23 K), 1.0e-18 at E_cm 100 K,
  2.2e-19 at 1 eV lab, 1.4e-19 at ~8 eV lab, 4.9e-20 at 500 eV lab.
- Synthetic check (uniform 23 K, 2e22 m^-3 Ne, 500 eV injection, 20 ions): mean
  stopping depth 14 mm (table) vs 8.8 mm (old edep), 11 mm (const 1.5e-19),
  0.8 mm (const 2e-18); ~40 collisions to thermalize.
- Uncertainty: thermal/low-energy end +-10-15% (set by exact long-range physics);
  above ~1 eV +-30-40% (short-range wall) -- bracket with
  `--sigma-table-variant low` and `high`. No BaF+-Ne cross section has been
  measured; Ba+ stands in for BaF+.
- The default table is only valid for BaF+ in Ne; the tracer refuses to start with
  it for other masses.

Run the `central` table as the main condition, plus `--sigma-table-variant low` and
`high` as the uncertainty bracket. The older discussion below is kept for history.

**Cross section -- revised, read this if you ran the transmission
numbers from an earlier version of this doc.** The first version used a
single constant `--sigma`, scanned between two disconnected guesses
(5.0e-19 and 1.5e-19 m^2), and found the transmission fraction changed a
lot between them (72% vs. 89%) -- a real, unresolved uncertainty at the
time. Two things changed since:

1. The tracer now supports (and defaults to) an **energy-dependent cross
   section** (`--sigma-energy-dependent`, on by default) instead of a
   single constant: `sigma-low` at/below the local buffer-gas thermal
   speed, falling off as 1/v (Langevin capture scaling -- the standard
   result that the capture cross section for a polarization-dominated
   ion-neutral potential scales as 1/v, so the *rate constant* sigma*v is
   velocity-independent) down to a `sigma-high` floor at high relative
   speed. This reuses the same two numbers as before as physically
   connected endpoints of one energy-dependent curve, not an arbitrary
   bracket -- see `sigma_of_speed()`'s docstring in the source for the
   full derivation. The old constant-sigma mode still exists
   (`--sigma-energy-dependent 0 --sigma <value>`) for direct comparison
   if you want it.
2. **`sigma-low` was revised up, from 5.0e-19 to 2.0e-18 m^2** (4x), based
   on real measured data found in a follow-up literature search: two
   independent buffer-gas-cooling papers directly measured the BaF
   (neutral) + He collision cross section --
   1.4e-18 m^2 (*Phys. Rev. A* 95, 032701 (2017)) and 2.7e-18 m^2 (arXiv
   1906.08798) -- in good agreement with each other. The earlier 5.0e-19
   value was an indirect extrapolation (Ba+ ion mobility in He/Ar, not
   BaF, converted through a mobility formula and then polarizability-
   scaled to Ne); this new value is scaled from a direct measurement of
   the actual molecule, just in He instead of Ne, so only one scaling
   step (polarizability, He->Ne) instead of two. It's still for the
   neutral molecule, not the BaF+ ion actually being traced -- ion-
   induced-dipole attraction should make the true ionic value equal or
   larger, so treat 2.0e-18 as more a lower bound than a central estimate.

`sigma-high` (1.5e-19 m^2) is UNCHANGED and still just a physical-
reasoning estimate (summed ionic/atomic radii) -- no high-energy (eV-keV
range) literature data for this or a closely analogous ion-neutral system
was found in either literature search. One loose signal from general
ion-atom scattering literature (a shallower E^(-1/3) power law reported
for elastic-scattering amplitude in some systems, not confirmed to apply
to this one) hints the true high-energy cross section may fall off more
gradually than this model's 1/v form assumes -- i.e. sigma-high may be
reached more gradually and stay higher across more of the trajectory than
predicted. Not a number to plug in, just a reason not to over-trust the
high-energy end of this model either.

**Given both ends are still uncertain, run and report at least three
conditions**, not one: the default energy-dependent model, and the old
constant-sigma pair (`--sigma-energy-dependent 0 --sigma 2.0e-18` and
`--sigma-energy-dependent 0 --sigma 1.5e-19`) as bounding comparisons. If
the flow-rate conclusion is the same across all three, the remaining
cross-section uncertainty doesn't block the decision; if it isn't, that's
important to know before trusting any single number.

**What "success" and "loss" mean in the output** (columns: `idx x y z
xnext ynext znext vx vy vz collides time`; `xnext,ynext,znext` is where
the particle's path actually ended):
- Transmitted: `xnext` near 0.08255 m (the molecule-outlet port, per
  `gen_fluor3d.py`'s `MOLECULE_OUTLET` location) and `collides` typically
  large (it thermalized and diffused out, not just... coasting straight
  through unimpeded, which is worth checking, see below).
- Lost back out the inlet: `xnext` near 0.03048 m again.
- Stuck on a wall: `xnext` on the housing wall (i.e. NOT at either port's
  x/y/z), matching the existing 2D convention that molecules "stick when
  they hit a wall" -- `collide!`/`propagate` returns as soon as
  `getCollision` reports a wall hit, so a "stuck" particle's final
  `xnext,ynext,znext` in the output IS where it stuck.
Aggregate over runs: transmission fraction = (# ending near the outlet) /
`n`. `--saveall 1` prints every particle regardless of outcome (needed to
compute this ratio); the default (0) only prints particles that left the
simulation BOX bounds, which is a different, box-edge-based criterion
that will undercount "reached the outlet" if the box extends past it (it
does, per the scoping deck's placeholder `create_box`).

## 4. Validation checklist -- do this before trusting a real result

1. **Energy sanity**: for a sample of transmitted/lost particles, is the
   exit speed (`sqrt(vx^2+vy^2+vz^2)`) much lower than the 24843.71 m/s
   injection speed, comparable to the neon field's own velocity scale
   (tens to hundreds of m/s)? If particles are exiting still near
   injection speed with very few `collides`, something is wrong (wrong
   density/cross-section scale, or the particle punched through without
   really seeing the gas) -- don't trust a transmission fraction from
   that run.
2. **Collision count sanity**: cross-check the reported `collides` per
   particle against a rough estimate: mean free path lambda =
   1/(nrho*sigma) using the buffer gas density near the inlet from your
   completed neon run, and the cell's own physical scale (~50mm). A wildly
   different order of magnitude from what a simple diffusion estimate
   (steps ~ (distance/lambda)^2) suggests is worth investigating before
   trusting the run.
3. **Free-edge-style sanity for the tracer's own geometry read**: confirm
   `read_surf3d` parsed the expected point/triangle counts -- add a quick
   `println(length(points), " ", length(triangles))` right after the
   `read_surf3d` call if you want to eyeball this against
   `check_surf3d.py`'s own reported counts for the same file.
4. **Reproducibility**: same `--seed`, same thread count -> same result
   (per the existing 2D file's own documented caveat: threaded runs only
   reproduce at a FIXED thread count, not across different `--threads`
   values). If you can't reproduce a run with its own recorded seed, don't
   trust its output.
5. Run all three cross-section conditions from section 3 (energy-
   dependent default, and both constant-sigma bounds) and report all
   three, not just the default.

## 5. What this deliberately does NOT model

Carried over from the project discussion that scoped this work, restated
here since it's easy to lose track of once there's a working pipeline
producing numbers:

- **No dissociation / internal energy exchange.** BaF+ is treated as a
  single rigid point mass throughout. A single hard early collision can
  plausibly transfer more energy than BaF's ~5-6 eV bond dissociation
  energy; this model has no way to represent the molecule breaking apart,
  and silently assumes it survives intact for the whole trajectory. If
  the actual question depends on survival fraction (not just transport),
  this model cannot answer it.
- **No charge exchange or other reactive channels.**
- **Energy-independent cross section** (a single `--sigma` value across
  the whole 500eV-to-thermal slowing-down range), not a physically
  modeled energy-dependent one. The sensitivity scan in section 3 is the
  mitigation for this, not a fix for it.
- **No ion-guide/applied field.** Free-flight legs are straight lines
  (unlike the 2D file's harmonic-trap-aware propagation, which isn't
  applicable here since there's no such field in this cell -- confirm
  that assumption is actually right for your setup before trusting a
  trajectory shape).
- **Frozen buffer-gas field** (same one-way-coupling assumption the 2D
  pipeline documents) -- a single 500 eV ion's energy deposition into the
  gas is assumed negligible against the gas's own heat capacity at your
  ion flux; this hasn't been explicitly checked against your actual ion
  rate.
- **`StatsArray`'s r/z binning is a 2D SUMMARY PROJECTION** (axial x vs.
  distance off the x-axis), kept for continuity with the 2D file's output
  shape. It is not itself 3D physics and will not show y/z asymmetry from
  the off-axis gas inlet -- fine for a quick profile, not for anything
  that needs real 3D spatial resolution.

## 6. What to report back

- Whether the smoke test (section 2) and a real statistics-quality run
  (larger `-n`, at least a few hundred particles per condition) completed
  cleanly.
- Transmission / lost-to-inlet / stuck-on-wall fractions, at all three
  cross-section conditions from section 3, for whatever flow rate(s) the
  completed neon run(s) used.
- Results of the validation checklist in section 4 -- not just "it ran,"
  but whether the numbers hold together physically.
- If you scan flow rate: which completed neon runs (or newly-run ones at
  different `MDOT`/`FILLN`) you traced against, and the resulting
  transmission-fraction-vs-flow-rate trend.
