# Checkpointed (mirrors cases/takahashi-3d's in.he_takahashi_3d_run/_resume
# pattern): writes a SPARTA restart file every CHECKPOINT_STEPS, so a job
# killed early (walltime limit, node failure) doesn't lose all progress --
# resume from the latest restart.<step> file with in.ne_fluor3d_resume
# (see docs/hpc-fluor-cell-3d-handoff.md for how to check that). Chunked to
# match the field.grid dump cadence (20000 steps/frame): 6 chunks x 20000 =
# 120000 steps total (12ms simulated) -- the same He-case-derived starting
# point as before, NOT yet verified sufficient for this grid/geometry. If
# the settled-field check shows it isn't settled, resume with more chunks
# instead of restarting from scratch.

# FNUM=1e11, not the doc's original 2.5e17 (carried over from the 2D
# cases/b5-lean case, which turned out wrong by ~5-6 orders of magnitude for
# this geometry -- 2.5e17 produced ZERO simulated particles for the entire
# duration of an earlier 120000-step run, since it rounds both the initial
# fill and the mflow injection rate to 0). Chosen via a short 3-point
# mit_quicktest scan (1e12/5e11/1e11, 10000 steps each): all three gave
# adequate per-cell statistics, but all were also trivially cheap relative
# to the 6h budget here, so 1e11 (~667 particles/occupied cell, ~30min
# extrapolated) was picked for the extra statistics near the under-resolved
# small ports, not because it was the minimum that worked.
